0.13.0 Unreleased
-----------------

* Introduce a send method on the conenction which accepts the new
  events. This requires the following usage changes,
    connection.accept(subprotocol=subprotocol) -> connection.send(AcceptConnection(subprotocol=subprotocol))
    connection.send_data(data) -> connection.send(Message(payload=payload))
    connection.close(code) -> connection.send(CloseConnection(code=code))
    connection.ping() -> connection.send(Ping())
    connection.pong() -> connection.send(Pong())
* The Event structure is altered to allow for events to be sent and
  received, this requires the following name changes in existing code,
    ConnectionRequested -> Request
    ConnectionEstablished -> AcceptConnection
    ConnectionClosed -> CloseConnection
    DataReceived -> Message
    TextReceived -> TextMessage
    BytesReceived -> BytesMessage
    PingReceived -> Ping
    PongReceived -> Pong
* Introduce RejectConnection and RejectData events to be used by a
  server connection to reject rather than accept a connection or by a
  client connection to emit the rejection response. The RejectData
  event represents the rejection response body, if present.
* Add an extra_headers field to the AcceptConnection event in order to
  customise the acceptance response in server mode or to emit this
  information in client mode.
* Switch from Fail events being returned to RemoteProtocolError`s being
  raised.
* Switch from ValueError`s to LocalProtocolError`s being raised when
  an action is taken that is incompatible with the connection state or
  websocket standard.
* Enforce version checking in SERVER mode, only 13 is supported.

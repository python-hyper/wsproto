Release History
===============

1.0.0+dev
---------

- Prevent invalid window bit sizes.
- Added support for Python 3.8 and 3.9.


0.15.0 (2019-08-10)
-------------------

**This contains all the Bugfixes in the 0.14 branch.**

- Drop support for Python 2. Please pin to ~= 0.14.0 if you support
  Python 2.
- Drop support for Python 3.5, meaning the minimum supported version
  is Python 3.6.1.
- Switch events to be dataclass based, otherwise the API is
  consistent.
- Add type hints throughout and support PEP 561 via a py.typed
  file. This should allow projects that use wsproto to type check their
  usage of wsproto.
- Bugfix prevent the test folder being installed as a package called
  test.
- Explicitly require Host header in handshake.
- Drop wsaccel support and utilise the aiohttp/@willmcgugan masking
  method. wsaccel is unmaintained and this new masking method is
  almost as quick.

0.14.1 (2019-05-30)
-------------------

- Loosen the h11 requirement to >= 0.8.1 as wsproto is compatible with
  0.9 onwards.
- Stop installing a "test" package on installation.

0.14.0 (2019-04-06)
-------------------

- Bugfix clarify subprotocol type as str not bytes.
- Support HTTP/2 WebSockets. This requires a HTTP/2 parser (not
  included), with hyper-h2 recommended. It renames
  ``handshake_extensions`` and hence is a breaking change.
- Bugfix badly formatted type hints.
- Bugfix minor issues identified by type checking.

0.13.0 (2019-01-24)
-------------------

- Introduce a send method on the connection which accepts the new
  events. This requires the following usage changes, ::

    connection.accept(subprotocol=subprotocol) -> connection.send(AcceptConnection(subprotocol=subprotocol))
    connection.send_data(data) -> connection.send(Message(payload=payload))
    connection.close(code) -> connection.send(CloseConnection(code=code))
    connection.ping() -> connection.send(Ping())
    connection.pong() -> connection.send(Pong())

- The Event structure is altered to allow for events to be sent and
  received, this requires the following name changes in existing code, ::

    ConnectionRequested -> Request
    ConnectionEstablished -> AcceptConnection
    ConnectionClosed -> CloseConnection
    DataReceived -> Message
    TextReceived -> TextMessage
    BytesReceived -> BytesMessage
    PingReceived -> Ping
    PongReceived -> Pong

- Introduce RejectConnection and RejectData events to be used by a
  server connection to reject rather than accept a connection or by a
  client connection to emit the rejection response. The RejectData
  event represents the rejection response body, if present.
- Add an extra_headers field to the AcceptConnection event in order to
  customise the acceptance response in server mode or to emit this
  information in client mode.
- Switch from Fail events being returned to raising ``RemoteProtocolError``.
- Switch from ValueError`s to LocalProtocolError`s being raised when
  an action is taken that is incompatible with the connection state or
  websocket standard.
- Enforce version checking in SERVER mode, only 13 is supported.
- Add an event_hint to RemoteProtocolErrors to hint at how to respond
  to issues.
- Switch from a ``bytes_to_send`` method to the ``send`` method
  returning the bytes to send directly. Responses to Ping and Close
  messages must now be sent (via ``send``), with the ``Ping`` and
  ``CloseConnection`` events gaining a ``response`` method. This
  allows ::

    if isinstance(event, Ping):
        bytes_to_send = connection.send(event.response())
- Separate the handshake from the active connection handling. This
  allows the handshake and connection to be seperately used. By
  default though WSConnection does both.
- ``receive_bytes`` is renamed to ``receive_data`` and
  ``WSConnection`` should be imported from ``wsproto`` rather than
  ``wsproto.connection``.

0.12.0 (2018-09-23)
-------------------

- Support h11 ~0.8.1.
- Support Python 3.7.
- Make the close-handshake more explicit, by sending a close frame on
  reciept of a close frame.
- Bugfix fix deflate after a non-compressable message.
- Bugfix connection header acceptance, by accepting Connection header
  values that are comma separated lists.

0.11.0 (2017-12-31)
-------------------

- Separate extension handling into its own method.
- Add events for PING and PONG frames.
- Stop supporting Python 3.4.
- Large increase in tests and test coverage.
- Bugfix extension accept for empty strings.
- Bugfix raise if default arguments are invalid.

0.10.0 (2017-05-03)
